## What is Indy Labs?

Indy Labs is a subset of [Indy Hall](http://indyhall.org) dedicated to enriching the Indy Hall experience. In a nutshell we volunteer small pieces of our time to improve existing systems and experiment with new ideas to improve the coworking community.

## Why Indy Labs?

Indy Hall is built on the idea of **JDFI** (just f-ing do it) but some tasks are too large, complex, or long term for us to **JFDI** ourselves. Indy Labs is aimed empowering Indy Hall members to solve complex problems by distributing the workload throughout the community, and by providing a central source of support to help every project succeed.

## How is Indy Labs going to do that?

* Those interested in being involved in Indy Labs provide a little bit of background regarding their interests and expertise, so that those looking to undertake a project can be matched up with people that have the knowledge and experience to help them through it.

* Indy Labs organizers take responsibility for maintaining information regarding Indy Hall's inventory of tools, technology, and other resources so that members can get access to what they need to work on a project.

* Indy Labs organizers will maintain information regarding project ideas as well as ongoing projects, so that if a project falls out of favor other members have a chance to pick it up and continue carrying the torch.

* Indy Labs will have a timeslot at Show & Tell as well as Town Hall so everyone can contribute ideas and feedback, and Indy Labs volunteers have a chance to show off their work to the community.

* Indy Labs maintains a Slack channel and will meet informally during things like Show & Tell to keep the collaboration going.

## What kind of projects are being working on?

At this point all projects are in their planning stage but some proposed projects include:

* Overhauling [hello.indyhall.org](hello.indyhall.org) to make it a comprehensive member portal.
* Creating a website for indylabs (labs.indyhall.org) for keeping track of projects and collecting ideas
* An updated version of [indyhall.org](indyhall.org)
* An electronic check-in system
* An API for Indy Hall that would allow any member to create their own apps benefiting members

## Do I have to be a Techie?

**Nope**. Indy Labs is open to projects of all kinds, not just technology-oriented projects. Additionally many tech-projects actually require a lot of none technical help (drafting content, designing interfaces, writing documentation, etc). We also want to make sure ideas are coming from everyone, not just the tech-minded portion of Indy Hall!

## Does it take a lot of time/commitment to be involved?

**Nope**. The purpose of Indy Labs is to distribute the process as much as possible across the community, while still having a small core group around to make sure good ideas aren't lost and abandoned. That doesn't mean forcing anyone to help out, it means keeping things organized so that members can pick things up when others have had their fill. Nothing is required, and even very small chunks of time are appreciated.

## I have an idea but maybe its dumb

The name Indy **Labs** is born out of the notion that this is all experimental. The purpose is to think outside of the box and try new things, so don't be afraid to contribute any and all ideas! We believe the cream will float to the top and the best ideas will find their way into daily life at the Hall. That doesn't mean every idea has to pan out - we're here to learn and have fun!

## How can I get involved?

* If you already have an idea of something you'd like to work on **JFDI** but you're welcome to post about it via Slack and Groupbuzz to see if anyone might be interested in helping you out!
