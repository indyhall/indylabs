* Establishing a single source of data for all of the various components of Indy Hall (member information, knowledge, events, etc.)

* Creating a system that allows any Indy Hall member to create technology to benefit the hall without being tied to a specific technology stack.

* Providing better means for members to keep up with and process all that Indy Hall has to offer.

* Implementing analytics to gain a better understanding of how Indy Hall functions and its future needs.
